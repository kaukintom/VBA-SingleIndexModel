# VBA-SingleIndexModel
Download stock data to a particular Index (ex. ^GSPTSE - S&amp;P/TSX Composite index) using Alpha Vantage API keys and then calculates the market portfolio and the integer values of how much to invest in each stock.
# Version 2
1. Sub Procedure TickerDataCollect() performs much faster, can gather the data of the example list of stocks from the S&amp;P/TSX Composite index in less than 10 minutes
    - Gathers data from a json format instead of csv
2. Fixed issues with the dates not aligning among stocks, making the OLS regression unreliable
    - Stocks are not included if portions of the data are missing
    - If a date of data is missing, where the date exists for another stock, the date is added to the stock where it does not exist for, and the stock price associated with that date is its previous close price
3. The visual maintenance of the worksheets "Stock List" and "Stock Data" has been improved
# API key
Can receive an API key from alphavantage.com or https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key 
# Data Used
- Daily adjusted close return data for all calculations to determine % allocation
- Daily close price (not adjusted) used for integer allocation
- Up to 4 months of return data is used (can choose to use up to 4 months of portfolio analysis)
- Risk free rate (Rf) determined from Bank of Canada T-Bill rates at https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/interest-rates/t-bill-yields/
  - T-Bill rate is converted to a daily return based average number of data points from daily stock returns in a year
# Calculations
- OLS regression between each stock and the index is used to determine alpha (𝜶<sub>i</sub>)  and beta (Β<sub>i</sub>)
- Variance of a stock determined by  Β<sup>2</sup><sub>ie</sub>𝝈<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>+𝝈<sup>2</sup><sub>ie</sub>
- covariance between stocks determined by  Β<sub>i</sub>Β<sub>j</sub>𝝈<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>
- Phi (𝚽) = (𝝈<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>∑<sup>n</sup><sub>j=1</sub>Β<sub>j</sub>(µ<sub>j</sub> − Rf)/𝝈<sup>2</sup><sub>je</sub>)/(1+𝝈<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>∑<sup>n</sup><sub>j=1</sub>B<sup>2</sup><sub>j</sub>/𝝈<sup>2</sup><sub>ie</sub>)
- For short selling to not be permitted, securities are ranked by excess returns over beta ((µ<sub>1</sub>-Rf)/(Β<sub>1</sub>))
  - Securities are added until 𝚽 is maximized
- Security weights in tangent portfolio Z<sub>i</sub>=B<sub>i</sub>/(𝝈<sup>2</sup><sub>ie</sub>)*((µ<sub>i</sub>-Rf)/B<sub>i</sub>-𝚽), where x<sub>i</sub> = z<sub>i</sub>/(∑<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub>z<sub>i</sub>)
# VBA
Module: Collect_Stock_Data<br />
Sub Procedure: TickerDataCollect
 - Collects stock and index data from Alpha Vantage from API key
 - Drawback: Currently uses a fixed 5 second delay per a security to allow the csv to open and display the data
  - Time consuming
  
Module: Portfolio<br />
Sub Procedure: OLSRegression
 - Calculates the portfolio composition of stocks and their allocation as a %
 - Determines the integer value of each stock an investor should invest in to minimize variance or maximize return
 - Quick runtime (< 1 second)

Module: TransferPriceData<br />
Sub Procedure: Transfer_Table
 - The allocation table created from OLSRegression can be moved to avoid being deleted if OLSRegression is used again

Module: UpdatePriceDate<br />
Sub Procedure: GetPriceData
 - Update the table saved from Transfer_Table with the most current price data
 - Calculates the return to date and dollar value return
# How to Use
1.	On the “Stock List” worksheet in the excel file, the columns “Symbol” and “Index” need to be filled in
    - Ex. Each stock from S&amp;P/TSX Composite index is put under the symbol column, and the index symbol is put in the index column next to the symbol
    - Also, each stock symbol needs to include the exchange symbol as well (Ex. .TO for Toronto Stock Exchange – GUY.TO)
2.	Download the stock data through the API key from Alpha Vantage using the TickerDataCollect sub procedure
    - Will only download 100 daily adjusted close prices for each stock (approx. 5 months of data)
3.	Can create the market portfolio (Portfolio where risk-free security is tangent to the efficient frontier) by using the OLSRegression sub procedure
    - Must provide a risk-free rate (obtained from Bank of Canada T-Bills as an annual rate, OLSRegression will turn it into a daily rate) 
    - Must provide an investment amount and time frame (1 to 4 months)
4.	Can choose to keep table produced from OLSRegression by using the Transfer_Table sub procedure 
5.	If Table is kept, can use the GetPriceData sub procedure to update the new prices of the stocks to calculate portfolio return
